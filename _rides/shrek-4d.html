            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                In the queue, we watch clips from the first Shrek movie and admire the posters satirizing popular Disney
                attractions. Then we are moved into the dungeon where we get our Ogre-Vision glasses. The Three Little
                Pigs, the Gingerbread Man and Pinocchio wake up in cages attached to the ceiling. They tell us teh story
                of how Lord Farquad captured them. The Magic Mirror wakes up and recaps the story (after digressing into
                a quick Star Wars style anecdote) of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/">first
                    movie</a>. The ghost of Farquad interrupts the story to demand that the Mirror tell him where Shrek
                and Fiona are. Farquad catches Pinocchio lying and orders his torturer Felonious to turn Pinocchio into
                firewood and the pigs into a luau. After questioning us, he orders us into his auditorium to be
                torutured. As we move into the toruture chamber, the curtains pull back and we see Shrek and Donkey
                trying to find a route to their honeymoon. Felonious runs up on a horse and kidnaps Felonious. Shrek and
                Donkey pursue in their carriage. They lose their carriage after a jump into the graveyard and start
                searching for Fiona there. Farquad's ghost animates a giant stone dragon who chases them until Donkey
                calls his own dragon. On the back of the dragon, they catch up to Fiona only to be chased by the stone
                dragon. Diving into a trench, they mimic the Death Star trench run from STar Wars, eventually causing
                the pursuing stone dragon to lose its wings. Farquad and Felonious float down a river getting closer and
                closer to a waterfall. Farquad reveals that he means to let Fiona die so that he can be with her ghost.
                Right as she's about to fall down the waterfall, Shrek and Donkey show up and catch Fiona on their
                dragon. The dragon shoots a fireball at Farquad and he disappears. The movie then cuts to the Hotel
                Honeymoon where Shrek and Fiona are happily spending their honeymoon.
