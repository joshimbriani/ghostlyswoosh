            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                We wait in the queu and watch Simpson's clips and see posters for the vrious rides at Krustyland. As we
                enter the first preshow room, we see various Springfield residents including Apu and Selma manning
                carnival booths. Eventually Krusty comes on the TV and tells us he's looking to pick a family to be the
                first to ride his new thrill ride. Sideshow Bob, disguised as Scratchy, steps on Homer's foot, causing
                his to "D'Oh" and getting Krusty's attention, as he picks the Simpsons. The Simpsons select us to go
                along with them. We are then lead into individual rooms where watch Maggie get away from Grampa Simpson.
                Before Sideshow Bob forces us into our ride vehicles he makes us watch a safety video. After the Itchy
                and Scratchy safety video finishes, we board our vehicle and get ready to ride. AFter we are settled,
                Krusty takes over our ride and makes the vehicle rise to the main room. We ride a simulated roller
                coaster until Homer gets knocked off the ride by a wrecking ball which knocks us off too. We get knocked
                into a kid's ride themed to Pandas with Bart and Lisa until Bob bursts in riding a giant panda robot and
                knocks us out of the area into a simulated water ride with Homer and Marge. Bob tells Homer to resist
                the tempatations upcoming and he will be safe. Naturally, Homer can't resist beer which starts a chain
                reaction that blows us out of the ride and into a water animal show. Bob corners us and blows open a
                hole down to the center of the Earth. Maggie, who at this point is a radiation infused giant baby, grabs
                Bob and slams him into our vehicle which knocks us into the hole. Luckily we're saved by Professor Frink
                in his flying car. At this point, we fly around Springfield seeing the havoc that Maggie is wrecking.
                She grabs us and sucks on our vehicle. We then see the Simpsons sit on their couch but the couch becomes
                a drop ride. We fall with them right in front of Bob who takes a step towards us to kill us until the
                Simpsons dop on top of him. We then exit our ride vehicles.
