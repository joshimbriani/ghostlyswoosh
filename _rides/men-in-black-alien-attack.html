            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                The posters and decorations in line point to a World's Fair exhibit named The Universe and You. We enter
                into a room full of stained glass and an attendent starts a narration that introduces us to our Universe
                and You exhibit. Until suddenly the narration comes to a halt and a voice welcomes us recruits to the
                Men In Black training facility. The wall opens and an MIB agent tells us to get into teh elevator. After
                we get out of the elevator, we queue past various MIB aliens and props. We then enter the immigration
                room where aliens from the ride oversee the various extraterrestrial activities with alarms going off
                every so often when aliens threaten to blow up Earth. Eventually we make our way to the main part of the
                building where we board our vehicles and start off on our training. We enter the training room and blast
                the targets until MIB Director Zedd tells us that a prison transport ship crashed in NYC and he needs
                our help to round them up. We go through a New York street packed full of aliens. We go into an alley
                and get ambushed by an alien and spin out of control. We then go through a scanner facing the other
                track's cars and find out that they're really aliens. If we hit their fusion exhaust port over their
                ride vehicle they wpin out of control, but so do we if they hit ours. Finally, Agent J comes on the TVs
                at Times Square anf tells us that there's one massive alien that escaped. As we round the corner we can
                see him but our guns have no effect. We enter his mouth only to be told to push our red button and
                deploy our Subatmoic Thermonuclear Disruptor which defeats the alien. J comes on the screen again at
                this point and congratulates whichever side had more points. We see whichever ending of the ride our car
                earned and then are neuralyzed so we don't remember anything of it. We pull back into the station to a
                huge sign telling us that of course we're alone in the universe!
