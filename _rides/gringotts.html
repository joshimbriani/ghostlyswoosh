            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                We start our adventure by entering the Gringotts lobby. We've been invited in as muggles to tour the
                vault. We walk past the goblins and down the stairs to a room where Gringotts employees take our
                pictures and point us in the right direction. As we wait, we can hear Harry, Ron and Hermione planning
                their break-in to Gringotts, although at this point, they don't know we're here. We're lead into a room
                where We go into a room where a goblin explains some safety rules for us and beckons us into an elevator
                that'll take us down to Gringotts. We descend into the depths of Gringotts banks and step out at the
                base of a large spiral staircase. After we grab our safety goggles, we climb to the top of the staircase
                and enter our vehicle. We pull into a large cavern and see Bill Weasley and his Gringotts escort ahead
                of us when suddenly the alarms go off and we're warned that there are imposters in Gringotts. Then to
                our right comes Bellatrix Lestrange. She tests if we're imposters by casting a spell that causes the
                track we're sitting on to tilt, leaving us hanging over an abyss. We plummet down and speed away only to
                come to a stop at the hands of Bill's spell. After he stops us we see Harry, Ron and Hermione speed by
                in their own cart after stealing a Horcrux. Security trolls reach up and grab our car, spinning it into
                the next room. As they wind up to hit us with their clubs, they trip and drag us down into the caves
                until we're stopped by Bill again. A dragon bursts through the cavern with Harry and company on its
                back. Bill sends us on our way as Gringotts security staff tries to stop the dragon. We enter the vault
                area where we see our frienly goblin beckoning us to safety. As we follow his instructions, a snake
                breaks through the wall and lunges at us until it is stopped by Voldemort and Bellatrix! He questions us
                and Bellatrix casts a spell on us as we go into the next room, a lava filled cavern. Voldemort appears
                and casts a fireball spell at us which nearly hits us until the dragon bursts through the cave and blows
                its own fire to knock the fireball out of the way. As Voldemort and Bellatrix flee, Harry hooks us to
                the dragon and our carts get pulled to safety. The last thing we see before we get back to the station
                is Bill telling us that Gringotts is still the safest place on Earth!
