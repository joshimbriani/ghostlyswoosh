### Where Our Site Came From

Our site started with a blog post lamenting the sad state of current theme park fan sites. Our founder grew up in the mid to late 2000s when fan sites like Great Adventure Online and IOACentral ruled the roost. These sites posted the latest news, sure, but they also had a deep well of content and information about the rides that we all know and love. Sure, today sites like [Great Adventure History](http://greatadventurehistory.com) still exist but for every GAH, there are 10 low effort Wordpress blogs that copy and paste press releases from the park while begging you to join their forums and donate your voice to fill their lack. And that's a shame, coaster enthusiasts deserve more.

Coaster enthusiasts deserve a well designed, informative fan site that doesn't just demand your contribution but gives back as much info as possible. Coaster enthusiasts deserve a site with a little more personality than can be found in a Wordpress theme. And we aim to give it to you.

Ghostly Swoosh brings you a full site of content, surfacing interesting facts, details and photos from Universal Studios Florida in addition to a community of intelligent, thoughtful users. Join our community or just enjoy the site, both are fine with us! But either way, we're glad to have your support for the next generation of theme park fan sites.

### Plans for the Future

Our ambition doesn't end here, though. We're working hard on building a companion fan site for Islands of Adventure. And fan sites for other parks will follow. Our ambition is to build the SB Nation for theme parks (with a little bit more personality for each site). So expect your Ghostly Swoosh login to work all through the network.

Expect a bigger presence on social media as well. We have some big plans for our Youtube, Twitter and Facebook accounts so expect some interesting things soon!

### Some More Info

We're obviously not the first USF/IOA fan site and we'd like to pay some tribute to those that came before us, as well as point you to some more resources if you're interested in learning more about these great parks!
